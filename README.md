My Hello World Repository

Hello World, My name is Ugochukwu Douglas-Chukwu. I am very excited to work on my first gitHub project and I am motivated to learn how to use Git and perharps complete some amazing projects with Git. I am comfortable using C and C++ languages, currently experimenting with Excel VBA, and Java. I have up to 1.5 years experience working as a Banking Systems software developer for Tangerine Bank, programming in Profile Scripting Language and MUMPS. I have been to 3 of the 7 continents, and I plan to visit all of them and possibly Space too.
